GROUP:
        Jin Rong Cao, Michelle Kee, Winnie Lam

Project:
        Canada Federal Bot: chatbot/federal political info system

Documentation:
        Some elements are missing of the documentation, for instance, what is the role of each of the required dependencies.
        

Implementation:
        Within the implementation, some elements are on the weak-side, e.g. documentation, comments, an overview or global picture of how the module/elements in the project interact.
        Similarly more granular details about the functions and modules used are missed.

Video-recording:
        Great presentation, I really liked the timeline description.
        Many of the details in the video could be included in the final report.

Comments:
        Very interesting idea, and well executed.
        One thing I found to be a weak point, is the documentation and report itself not making a fair job describing and explaining the different parts of the project at a more fundamental/technical level.
        It would be interesting to see the traffic pattern using wireshark or a similar packet sniffing  program.

Overall score: 18.5 out of 20.
